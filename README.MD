# Dual-Net-Gaming-with-Python
## Documentation "how to git":
1.  Clone repository with your favourite Git GUI of CLI. (I use GitKraken)
2.  Make a LOCAL branch of the last MASTER commit called e.g. "develop" (don't push that to remote repository)
3.  Select your local branch: that's where you will be working in.
4.  When a feature (or your work) is done:
Stage changes you want to stage
Commit changes (with a meaninful title and description)
5.  Go to MASTER branch
6.  Pull from remote
7.  Merge DEVELOP into MASTER
    *   solve merge conflicts
8.  Push commit
9.  go back to 3
10. COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES
